This program takes space delimited elevation data and constructs a greyscale image from in in a .PPM format
This program calculates the shortest path across the elevation using a greedy algorithm and hihglights it on the image. 
Three seperate paths are computed using different rules and all 3 are drawn on the image.
If you cannot open a .PPM file use a PPM to PNG converter to view the maps.
Some elevation data is here incase you do not want to load your own simply enter the correct number of rows and columns when using the programe
The elevation file is in row-column format for ease of use.
