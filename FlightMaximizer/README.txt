Program for my dad who flies a lot on company money and wanted to MAXIMIZE his flight time for extra earned miles on his trips.
Reads a database of airport data, uploaded the code that parsed it and built my own database of a subset of the airports with priorities.
Uses my own database to compute geo location of airports based on longitude and lattitude. 
Uses a weird algorithm to calculate the longest flight it can based on the number of segments the user wishes to fly and some hard coded preferences.
